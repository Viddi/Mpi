  Purpose:

    LAPLACE_MPI solves Laplace's equation on a rectangle, using MPI.

  Discussion:

    This program uses a finite difference scheme to solve
    Laplace's equation for a square matrix distributed over a square
    (logical) processor topology.  A complete description of the algorithm
    is found in Fox.

    This program works on the SPMD (single program, multiple data)
    paradigm.  It illustrates 2-d block decomposition, nodes exchanging
    edge values, and convergence checking.

    Each matrix element is updated based on the values of the four
    neighboring matrix elements.  This process is repeated until the data
    converges, that is, until the average change in any matrix element (compared
    to the value 20 iterations previous) is smaller than a specified value.

    To ensure reproducible results between runs, a red/black
    checkerboard algorithm is used.  Each process exchanges edge values
    with its four neighbors.  Then new values are calculated for the upper
    left and lower right corners (the "red" corners) of each node's
    matrix.  The processes exchange edge values again.  The upper right
    and lower left corners (the "black" corners) are then calculated.

    The program is currently configured for a 48x48 matrix
    distributed over four processors.  It can be edited to handle
    different matrix sizes or number of processors, as long as the matrix
    can be divided evenly between the processors.

  Parameters:

    Output, double M[nodeedge+2][nodeedge+2], the part of the results 
    kept by this process.

    Input, int WHERE, 0, 1, 2, or 3, indicates the edge to which the 
    data is to be applied.

    Input, int IN[nodeedge], the boundary data.
